# E-Commerce-Store

An E-commerce store with a microservice architecture. The Frontend will be deployed on AWS or Netflify. The API Gateway is deployed on AWS EC2. The microservices are deployed also deployed on AWS EC2, but as a monorepo, because I cannot deploy 11 Servers for free. Every microservice has it's on DB, PostgresSQL or MongoDB depending on the data.
